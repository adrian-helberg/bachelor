    abstract = {Procedural modelling deals with semi-automatic content generation by means of a program or procedure. Among other advantages, its data compression and the potential to generate a large variety of detailed content with reduced human intervention, have made procedural modelling attractive for creating virtual environments increasingly used in movies, games and simulations. We survey procedural methods that are useful to generate features of virtual worlds, including terrains, vegetation, rivers, roads, buildings and entire cities. In this survey, we focus particularly on the degree of intuitive control and of interactivity offered by each procedural method, because these properties are instrumental for their typical users: designers and artists. We identify the most promising research results that have been recently achieved, but we also realize that there is far from widespread acceptance of procedural methods among non-technical, creative professionals. We conclude by discussing some of the most important challenges of procedural modelling.},

    abstract = {This course presents a collection of state-of-the-art approaches for modeling and editing of 3D models for virtual worlds, simulations, and entertainment, in addition to real-world applications. The first contribution of this course is a coherent review of inverse procedural modeling (IPM) (i.e., proceduralization of provided 3D content). We describe different formulations of the problem as well as solutions based on those formulations. We show that although the IPM framework seems under-constrained, the state-of-the-art solutions actually use simple analogies to convert the problem into a set of fundamental computer science problems, which are then solved by corresponding algorithms or optimizations. The second contribution includes a description and categorization of results and applications of the IPM frameworks. Moreover, a substantial part of the course is devoted to summarizing different domain IPM frameworks for practical content generation in modeling and animation.},
